                    <h3>SoCalShredz began in 2012 when I made my first skateboard press and board. In 2015, I started shaping surfboards after watching loads of surf documentaries and having a desire to ride the nose. I took one shaping lesson made my first log and was absolutely hooked. Since then, SoCalShredz took off starting in my parents garage, and expanding into its own shaping room, and soon enough to a storefront. The addiction really began once my friends said holy shit you made that? It was at that time I thought maybe I could do this forever.  Since then, SoCalShredz has expanded obtaining five team riders, and creating five brand new board designs. We dont take things to seriously cause, well, surfing is supposed to be fun and thats what we want everybody to be able to have out there. </h3><br><h3>
                    We attended our first board room show this past May, and created a reputation as those guys from Pasadena with the funky surfboards, and we are funky. I make boards that are for everybody and make sure everybody can show off their own style and their own funk. Its all about creating what will give a rider the best experience and allow them to have the most fun. We are looking for creative minds and creative people cause we run off of creativity. I created SoCalShredz to follow what it is that I want to do every day which is enjoy doing what I love and having the most fun that is possible.</h3>
